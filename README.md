## Installation

To get started, you need to download the game files. You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/Glaxon2005/stone-paper-scissors/releases). Download the appropriate file and execute it in your terminal.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A terminal or command prompt

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the game files. Run the game using the command:
   ```bash
   python stone_paper_scissors.py
   ```
2. **Make Your Choice**: You will be prompted to choose either Stone, Paper, or Scissors.
3. **View Results**: After each round, the game will display your choice, the computer's choice, and the current score.
4. **Continue Playing**: You can keep playing until you decide to stop.

## Game Logic

The game follows these simple rules:

- Stone beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Stone

The game uses the `random` module to let the computer make its choice. This ensures that each round is unpredictable and fun.

## Code Structure

The code is organized in a straightforward manner:

- **Main Game Loop**: This section handles user input and game logic.
- **Score Tracking**: Variables to keep track of wins, losses, and ties.
- **Random Choice Function**: A function that generates the computer's choice.

Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of the main sections:

```python
import random

def get_computer_choice():
    return random.choice(['Stone', 'Paper', 'Scissors'])

def determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice):
    # Logic to determine the winner
    pass

def main():
    # Main game loop
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
